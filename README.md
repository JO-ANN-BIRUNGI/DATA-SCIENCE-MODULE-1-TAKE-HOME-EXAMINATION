Your task is to clean and explore data for a non-profit organization focused on promoting and increasing youth literacy rates. They are particularly interested in understanding where they should focus their next project and what strategies to use to have the biggest impact in increasing youth literacy rates in that area.
The dataset and dictionary are attached on the exam package. The original dataset is from data.world

Identify and address any duplicate values
Ensure all columns match the data types listed in the data dictionary.
Identify and address any inconsistencies in categorical values 
Identify and address any missing values in this dataset. Fill in missing values with a placeholder appropriate for the data type.
Identify and address any inappropriate or unusual data points.

2) The next step is to complete an exploration of the data using Python. This should include:

Two different types of univariate exploratory visualizations. Each visualization must include a brief interpretation within the code file.
Two different types of multivariate exploratory visualizations. Each visualization must include a brief interpretation within the code file.
